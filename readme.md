These are some old plugins that SSL had released for free on their website in the mid 2000s. They are no longer available on their main official site, but they are still mentioned on their site hosted in japan and the installation files still remain on their servers (to which we are linking to).

These installers will most likely not work on modern systems (Windows 10, MacOS)
